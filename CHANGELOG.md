# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Pre-1.0, minor versions may change the
agent-visible MCP surface; the result `fingerprint` changes when they do.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-20

The agent-visible surface changed (result `fingerprint` `codex-in-claude/0.1/schema-3` →
`codex-in-claude/0.1/schema-5`), so pre-1.0 this is a minor release. Clients that cache by
`fingerprint` re-fetch the contract.

### Added

- **Legible failure on stdio transport death.** `main()` now wraps the transport loop: a fatal error
  out of `mcp.run()` logs an actionable stderr breadcrumb (server name, version, reason, and a `/mcp`
  reconnect hint) and exits nonzero instead of dying silently, while clean disconnects
  (EOF / broken pipe / `SIGINT` / `SIGTERM`) are logged as shutdown rather than crashes. A minimal
  `SIGINT`/`SIGTERM` breadcrumb chains to the prior disposition (and leaves an inherited-ignored
  signal ignored). A stdio server can't be transparently auto-restarted — the client owns the pipe
  and `initialize` handshake — so recovery stays a manual `/mcp` reconnect, now documented in the
  README troubleshooting section. ([#76](https://github.com/briandconnelly/codex-in-claude/issues/76))
- **Per-tool stability + `listChanged` discovery metadata.** `codex_capabilities` now advertises an
  advisory per-tool `stability` field: the newer async (`codex_*_async`) and background-job lifecycle
  (`codex_job_*`) tools are marked `experimental`, while the sync core omits the field to inherit the
  server-wide `stability` ("alpha") — so an agent can tell the stateful M4 surface from the settled
  consult/review/delegate core. It is per-tool maturity metadata, distinct from the
  consult/propose/apply intent tier. The server also declares the tools `listChanged` capability (now
  pinned by a test) so clients know the contract even though the tool list is static per version.
  Adds an output-schema field, so the result `fingerprint` bumps `schema-4` → `schema-5`.
  ([#71](https://github.com/briandconnelly/codex-in-claude/issues/71))

### Changed

- **Tool input schemas declare their JSON Schema dialect.** Every tool's advertised input
  schema now carries `$schema` (`draft 2020-12`, the dialect Pydantic/FastMCP generate), so a
  client knows which draft to validate against (agent-friendly-mcp §3). The schemas were already
  *closed* (`additionalProperties: false`) and already reject unknown/misspelled arguments with a
  validation error rather than silently dropping them — that behavior is now pinned by a regression
  test across all tools. Accepted params, enums, and error codes are unchanged, but the advertised
  input schema did change, so the result `fingerprint` bumps `schema-3` → `schema-4` (clients cache
  by it). ([#70](https://github.com/briandconnelly/codex-in-claude/issues/70))
- **Sync active tools document their no-progress behavior.** The blocking `codex_consult`,
  `codex_review_changes`, and `codex_delegate` tool descriptions now state that they return only when
  Codex finishes and do not stream incremental `notifications/progress`, and point agents to the
  `*_async` variant + `codex_job_status` when they need live status or recoverability for a long run
  (a `codex_delegate` can run ~20s+). The domain `codex_job_*` surface remains the deliberate
  long-running-operation hedge; this is a description-only clarification (no `fingerprint` change).
  ([#72](https://github.com/briandconnelly/codex-in-claude/issues/72))

### Fixed

- **`codex_review_changes` now reviews explicitly-named untracked files.** With
  `scope="working_tree"` and `paths` targeting a brand-new (never-staged) file, the review
  silently returned "No changes to review" because `git diff HEAD` only sees tracked files. Named untracked
  (non-gitignored) files are now gathered too — staged into a throwaway index and diffed against the
  empty tree — so writing a file and reviewing it no longer requires a `git add` round-trip. Default
  behavior is unchanged (no `paths` ⇒ tracked changes only). Gathering is filter-free and writes no
  objects into the repo's own store, preserving the read-only/redacted posture.
  ([#74](https://github.com/briandconnelly/codex-in-claude/issues/74))

### Security

- **Broader best-effort secret redaction.** The diff/prose redactor now also catches shape-only
  (unlabeled) secrets: JWTs (`eyJ…` three-segment tokens), vendor key prefixes (OpenAI `sk-`/`sk-proj-`,
  Stripe `sk_live_`/`sk_test_`, Google `AIza…`), and connection-string passwords (`scheme://user:pass@host`,
  password redacted while scheme/user/host are preserved). Still best-effort defense-in-depth, not a
  guarantee; the agent-visible surface is unchanged (no `fingerprint` bump).
  ([#73](https://github.com/briandconnelly/codex-in-claude/issues/73))

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-19

Initial release: a Claude Code plugin that calls the OpenAI Codex CLI through a FastMCP server, so
an agent can hand work to Codex and get back a structured, bounded result.

### Added

- **Consult and review tools.** `codex_consult` gets a read-only second opinion; `codex_review_changes`
  produces a structured review (`verdict`/`confidence`) of the `working_tree`, a `branch`, or a single
  `commit`, optionally narrowed with `paths` and given author intent via `extra_context`. Both run under
  Codex's read-only sandbox — they are static reviews and do not execute the project's tests.
- **Delegation (propose tier).** `codex_delegate` implements a task in an isolated, throwaway git
  worktree and returns a reviewable diff that is never applied to your working tree. The inline diff is
  bounded (default 200 KB, `CODEX_IN_CLAUDE_MAX_DELEGATE_DIFF_BYTES`) and flags truncation in `meta`.
- **Background jobs.** `codex_consult_async`, `codex_review_changes_async`, and `codex_delegate_async`
  run detached and return a `job_id` immediately, so a long consult/review/delegate never blocks the
  caller. Manage them with `codex_job_status`, `codex_job_result`, `codex_job_consume_result`,
  `codex_job_cancel`, and `codex_job_list`. Job state is disk-backed under the state dir, survives
  server restarts, reconciles dead workers via PID liveness, and is bounded by a wall-clock deadline,
  TTL, and per-workspace count cap. `codex_job_status` returns a growing `poll_after_ms` backoff hint.
  Successful `codex_job_status`/`codex_job_list` (and `codex_job_cancel`) responses carry a compact
  `workspace` object (`cwd`, `workspace_source`, `workspace_warning`) so an agent can see which repo a
  lifecycle call targeted — and notice a cwd fallback — instead of silently polling the wrong
  workspace. ([#54](https://github.com/briandconnelly/codex-in-claude/issues/54))
- **Free preview and introspection tools.** `codex_status` (run first), `codex_dry_run` and
  `codex_delegate_dry_run` (zero-spend previews that report the prompt bytes and worktree baseline a
  real call would use, and run the same validations), and `codex_capabilities` (per-tool params,
  `output_schema`, and advisory `error_codes`). All spend nothing.
- **Structured result contract.** Every tool returns a single envelope (`src/codex_in_claude/schemas.py`)
  with per-tool success shapes: consult → answer + optional findings/questions/assumptions/next_steps;
  review → verdict + confidence; delegate → diff + summary. Errors carry machine-actionable repair
  metadata — `allowed_values`, `repair_tool`/`repair_tool_params`, and `retry_after_ms` — alongside a
  prose `repair` string. A rate-limited Codex run surfaces as `codex_rate_limited` with a populated
  `retry_after_ms` so callers back off deterministically. Fixed-value params (`scope`, `isolation`)
  advertise their choices as schema enums.
- **Detail levels for compact envelopes.** `codex_consult`, `codex_review_changes`, `codex_delegate`,
  and async result retrieval (`codex_job_result`, `codex_job_consume_result`) accept
  `detail="summary"` (the default) or `detail="full"`. The summary default omits the often-large,
  duplicative raw model text (`raw_response.text`) — the structured fields stay authoritative and the
  parser shape is stable (`raw_response` is still present with its `text` nulled). `detail="full"`
  returns the complete raw output for diagnostics. An invalid value is rejected as
  `unsupported_detail`. ([#56](https://github.com/briandconnelly/codex-in-claude/issues/56))
- **Safety boundaries.** Secret redaction, input-byte bounding (`CODEX_IN_CLAUDE_MAX_INPUT_BYTES`), an
  unexpanded-env-placeholder pre-flight check, and a per-tool boundary that converts an unexpected
  exception into an `internal_error` envelope instead of taking down the session. Diagnostic logging
  goes to stderr (never the stdio JSON-RPC channel), optionally to a file.
- **CLI contract.** Every assumption about the `codex` CLI lives in `src/codex_in_claude/cli_contract.py`. Guarantee-bearing
  flags are sent unconditionally and fail loudly as `cli_contract_changed` (zero spend) if rejected;
  depth-only flags are feature-detected and dropped gracefully.
- **Configuration knobs.** `CODEX_IN_CLAUDE_STATE_DIR`, `CODEX_IN_CLAUDE_JOB_TTL`,
  `CODEX_IN_CLAUDE_JOB_MAX_SECONDS`, `CODEX_IN_CLAUDE_JOB_MAX_COUNT`,
  `CODEX_IN_CLAUDE_MAX_INPUT_BYTES`, `CODEX_IN_CLAUDE_MAX_DELEGATE_DIFF_BYTES`,
  `CODEX_IN_CLAUDE_LOG_LEVEL`, and `CODEX_IN_CLAUDE_LOG_FILE`.
- **Slash commands.** `/codex:status`, `/codex:consult`, `/codex:review`, `/codex:delegate`,
  `/codex:delegate-async`, and `/codex:dry-run`.
- **`collaborating-with-codex` guidance skill** for agents working alongside this plugin.
- Result fingerprint: `codex-in-claude/0.1/schema-3`.

### Security

- **Redact secrets from delegate diffs.** `codex_delegate`/`codex_delegate_async` now run the
  proposed worktree diff through the same secret redaction as review diffs before returning it:
  secret-looking file hunks (e.g. `.env`, `*.pem`, `id_rsa`) are dropped (header kept), inline
  secret values become `[redacted: secret value]`, and the redacted paths are reported in
  `meta.redacted_paths`. The `context_summary` diffstat still reflects the full pre-redaction change.
  ([#57](https://github.com/briandconnelly/codex-in-claude/issues/57))
- **Redact secrets from Codex free-text output.** The inline-value redaction is now also applied to
  the free-text Codex returns — `summary`, `findings`/`questions`/`assumptions`/`next_steps`, and
  `raw_response.text` on `codex_consult`, `codex_review_changes`, and `codex_delegate` (sync and
  async) — so a secret echoed in prose (e.g. quoting a config file it read) becomes
  `[redacted: secret value]` rather than reaching the transcript verbatim. File-hunk dropping does
  not apply to prose; this is inline-value replacement only. Best-effort defense-in-depth, consistent
  with the diff redaction above; the schema is unchanged.
  ([#58](https://github.com/briandconnelly/codex-in-claude/issues/58))
- **Harden job recovery against PID reuse after a restart.** Background-job liveness no longer trusts
  a persisted PID via a bare `kill(0)` probe after the server restarts. Each worker now holds an
  exclusive advisory lock on `<job_dir>/worker.lock` for its lifetime, and the store uses that lock as
  the authority for liveness — a PID reused by an unrelated process cannot hold it, so
  `codex_job_status`, `codex_job_cancel`, and deadline reaping never report or signal an unrelated
  process. An unowned, unverifiable post-restart record is treated as not-running rather than signaled,
  and process-group signals are sent only to a verified group leader. Requires a local filesystem
  (POSIX `fcntl`). ([#55](https://github.com/briandconnelly/codex-in-claude/issues/55))
