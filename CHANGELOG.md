# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Pre-1.0, minor versions may change the
agent-visible MCP surface; the result `fingerprint` changes when they do.

## [Unreleased]

Initial release: a Claude Code plugin that calls the OpenAI Codex CLI through a FastMCP server, so
an agent can hand work to Codex and get back a structured, bounded result.

### Added

- **Consult and review tools.** `codex_consult` gets a read-only second opinion; `codex_review_changes`
  produces a structured review (`verdict`/`confidence`) of the `working_tree`, a `branch`, or a single
  `commit`, optionally narrowed with `paths` and given author intent via `extra_context`. Both run under
  Codex's read-only sandbox — they are static reviews and do not execute the project's tests.
- **Delegation (propose tier).** `codex_delegate` implements a task in an isolated, throwaway git
  worktree and returns a reviewable diff that is never applied to your working tree. The inline diff is
  bounded (default 200 KB, `CODEX_IN_CLAUDE_MAX_DELEGATE_DIFF_BYTES`) and flags truncation in `meta`.
- **Background jobs.** `codex_consult_async`, `codex_review_changes_async`, and `codex_delegate_async`
  run detached and return a `job_id` immediately, so a long consult/review/delegate never blocks the
  caller. Manage them with `codex_job_status`, `codex_job_result`, `codex_job_consume_result`,
  `codex_job_cancel`, and `codex_job_list`. Job state is disk-backed under the state dir, survives
  server restarts, reconciles dead workers via PID liveness, and is bounded by a wall-clock deadline,
  TTL, and per-workspace count cap. `codex_job_status` returns a growing `poll_after_ms` backoff hint.
  Successful `codex_job_status`/`codex_job_list` (and `codex_job_cancel`) responses carry a compact
  `workspace` object (`cwd`, `workspace_source`, `workspace_warning`) so an agent can see which repo a
  lifecycle call targeted — and notice a cwd fallback — instead of silently polling the wrong
  workspace. ([#54](https://github.com/briandconnelly/codex-in-claude/issues/54))
- **Free preview and introspection tools.** `codex_status` (run first), `codex_dry_run` and
  `codex_delegate_dry_run` (zero-spend previews that report the prompt bytes and worktree baseline a
  real call would use, and run the same validations), and `codex_capabilities` (per-tool params,
  `output_schema`, and advisory `error_codes`). All spend nothing.
- **Structured result contract.** Every tool returns a single envelope (`src/codex_in_claude/schemas.py`)
  with per-tool success shapes: consult → answer + optional findings/questions/assumptions/next_steps;
  review → verdict + confidence; delegate → diff + summary. Errors carry machine-actionable repair
  metadata — `allowed_values`, `repair_tool`/`repair_tool_params`, and `retry_after_ms` — alongside a
  prose `repair` string. A rate-limited Codex run surfaces as `codex_rate_limited` with a populated
  `retry_after_ms` so callers back off deterministically. Fixed-value params (`scope`, `isolation`)
  advertise their choices as schema enums.
- **Safety boundaries.** Secret redaction, input-byte bounding (`CODEX_IN_CLAUDE_MAX_INPUT_BYTES`), an
  unexpanded-env-placeholder pre-flight check, and a per-tool boundary that converts an unexpected
  exception into an `internal_error` envelope instead of taking down the session. Diagnostic logging
  goes to stderr (never the stdio JSON-RPC channel), optionally to a file.
- **CLI contract.** Every assumption about the `codex` CLI lives in `src/codex_in_claude/cli_contract.py`. Guarantee-bearing
  flags are sent unconditionally and fail loudly as `cli_contract_changed` (zero spend) if rejected;
  depth-only flags are feature-detected and dropped gracefully.
- **Configuration knobs.** `CODEX_IN_CLAUDE_STATE_DIR`, `CODEX_IN_CLAUDE_JOB_TTL`,
  `CODEX_IN_CLAUDE_JOB_MAX_SECONDS`, `CODEX_IN_CLAUDE_JOB_MAX_COUNT`,
  `CODEX_IN_CLAUDE_MAX_INPUT_BYTES`, `CODEX_IN_CLAUDE_MAX_DELEGATE_DIFF_BYTES`,
  `CODEX_IN_CLAUDE_LOG_LEVEL`, and `CODEX_IN_CLAUDE_LOG_FILE`.
- **Slash commands.** `/codex:status`, `/codex:consult`, `/codex:review`, `/codex:delegate`,
  `/codex:delegate-async`, and `/codex:dry-run`.
- **`collaborating-with-codex` guidance skill** for agents working alongside this plugin.
- Result fingerprint: `codex-in-claude/0.1/schema-2`.

### Security

- **Redact secrets from delegate diffs.** `codex_delegate`/`codex_delegate_async` now run the
  proposed worktree diff through the same secret redaction as review diffs before returning it:
  secret-looking file hunks (e.g. `.env`, `*.pem`, `id_rsa`) are dropped (header kept), inline
  secret values become `[redacted: secret value]`, and the redacted paths are reported in
  `meta.redacted_paths`. The `context_summary` diffstat still reflects the full pre-redaction change.
  ([#57](https://github.com/briandconnelly/codex-in-claude/issues/57))
- **Redact secrets from Codex free-text output.** The inline-value redaction is now also applied to
  the free-text Codex returns — `summary`, `findings`/`questions`/`assumptions`/`next_steps`, and
  `raw_response.text` on `codex_consult`, `codex_review_changes`, and `codex_delegate` (sync and
  async) — so a secret echoed in prose (e.g. quoting a config file it read) becomes
  `[redacted: secret value]` rather than reaching the transcript verbatim. File-hunk dropping does
  not apply to prose; this is inline-value replacement only. Best-effort defense-in-depth, consistent
  with the diff redaction above; the schema is unchanged.
  ([#58](https://github.com/briandconnelly/codex-in-claude/issues/58))
- **Harden job recovery against PID reuse after a restart.** Background-job liveness no longer trusts
  a persisted PID via a bare `kill(0)` probe after the server restarts. Each worker now holds an
  exclusive advisory lock on `<job_dir>/worker.lock` for its lifetime, and the store uses that lock as
  the authority for liveness — a PID reused by an unrelated process cannot hold it, so
  `codex_job_status`, `codex_job_cancel`, and deadline reaping never report or signal an unrelated
  process. An unowned, unverifiable post-restart record is treated as not-running rather than signaled,
  and process-group signals are sent only to a verified group leader. Requires a local filesystem
  (POSIX `fcntl`). ([#55](https://github.com/briandconnelly/codex-in-claude/issues/55))
